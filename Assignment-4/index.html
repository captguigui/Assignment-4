    <p>
        Vegeta was born of a warrior race on Planet Vegeta called Saiyans. He is the son of King Vegeta, true heir to the throne and prince of saiyans. Vegeta is considered an Elite Warrior, top of his class and second to none. That is, until he met his match with a so called low level warrior named Kakarot (Son Goku).
